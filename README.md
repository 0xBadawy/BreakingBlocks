## Introduction

The AI Puzzle Solver is a Python application that uses Pygame for graphical representation and implements various search algorithms to solve puzzles. The main focus is on artificial intelligence algorithms such as Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, A*, Uniform Cost Search, and others.

## Algorithms

The following search algorithms are implemented:

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Greedy Best-First Search
- A* Search

|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance Measure** | - The number of squares cleared in a given time.                                           |
|                      | - The time taken to complete the level and space.                                          |
| **Environment**         | - A grid of colored squares linked in a top, right, left, and bottom manner.               |
|                      | - The state of the environment changes as the agent makes moves to destroy interconnected squares.|
| **Actuators**           | - Select and destroy squares in the grid.                                                  |
| **Sensors**             | - The colors of the squares and their connectivity.                                        |
|                      | - Look at the last row to see if it is complete or not.                                    |
